## Generator for meetup poster

With generator you can create workshop poster to be posted in social media and telegram groups.

### Generating a picture

1. Edit content in `index.html.tmpl`
2. If formatting breaks, edit accordingly the CSS style in `style.css`
3. Run `make`
4. `screenshot.png` will be generated. Move that to `poster/{this-workshop}.png`
5. Send a PR with the change! We want to collect all backgrounds in the Git repo for wider re-use
